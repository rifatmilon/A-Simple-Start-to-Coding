# A-Simple-Start-to-Coding


# Welcome!
# This project is only for the memories that is aquired during the processes of programming journey (of Rifat)!

The tradition of programming is to write and print "Hello, World!" as the first program. 
This file was created when Rifat uses the Git for the very first time. Date: 02 Nov, 2023. And started successfully uploading codes to GitHub from 06 Nov, 2023.
The experience of learning Git was quite boring, as didn't understand the instructions first.. Then tried to know it again and again from different resources!
The best resource for version control in VS Code is here -> https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/versioncontrol
